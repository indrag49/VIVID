# VIVID
This is the code repository for our article titled "The VIVID function for numerically continuing periodic orbits arising from grazing bifurcations of hybrid dynamical systems."

- For fig. 1 run [schemPoinMap.m](https://github.com/indrag49/VIVID/blob/main/schemPoinMap.m).
- For fig. 2 run [impactOscillator.m](https://github.com/indrag49/VIVID/blob/main/impactOscillator.m).
- For fig. 3 run [goOneParamCont5.m](https://github.com/indrag49/VIVID/blob/main/goOneParamCont5.m). For generating fig. 3(a) you need to set runNum = 21 and run the code. For generating fig 3(b), first set runNum = 22, run the code and then set runNum = 23 and run the code again. 
- For fig. 4 first you need to generate the dataset (already uploaded in the repo, so you actually don't need to run it. But if you want to follow the pipline from scratch, please do!) by running the code [TwoParamDataGenerate.m](https://github.com/indrag49/VIVID/blob/main/TwoParamDataGenerate.m). For generating the dataset for period-doubling curve on the (A, ω)-plane set runNum = 21 and 22 separately. Similarly for generating the dataset for saddle-node curve on the (A, ω)-plane set runNum = 23 and 24 separately. Doing these will create the datasets [pp2_omega0.8_PD.csv](https://github.com/indrag49/VIVID/blob/main/pp2_omega0.8_PD.csv), [pp2_omega0.8_PDb.csv](https://github.com/indrag49/VIVID/blob/main/pp2_omega0.8_PDb.csv), [pp2_omega0.8_SN.csv](https://github.com/indrag49/VIVID/blob/main/pp2_omega0.8_SN.csv), and [pp2_omega0.8_SNb.csv](https://github.com/indrag49/VIVID/blob/main/pp2_omega0.8_SNb.csv). Once you have these you can generate fig 4(a) by running [goTwoParam.m](https://github.com/indrag49/VIVID/blob/main/goTwoParam.m) and fig 4(b) by running [goTwoParamB.m](https://github.com/indrag49/VIVID/blob/main/goTwoParamB.m).
