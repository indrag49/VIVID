# VIVID
This is the code repository for our article titled "The VIVID function for numerically continuing periodic orbits arising from grazing bifurcations of hybrid dynamical systems."

- For fig. 1 run [schemPoinMap.m](https://github.com/indrag49/VIVID/blob/main/schemPoinMap.m)
- For fig. 2 run [impactOscillator.m](https://github.com/indrag49/VIVID/blob/main/impactOscillator.m)
- For fig. 3 run [goOneParamCont5.m](https://github.com/indrag49/VIVID/blob/main/goOneParamCont5.m). For generating fig. 3(a) you need to set runNum = 21 and run the code. For generating fig 3(b), first set runNum = 22, run the code and then set runNum = 23 and run the code again.
